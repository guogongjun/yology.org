h1. yology

"Yology":http://yology.org/ is an open-source web app for online
genealogy, allowing you to compile, publish, and collaborate via the
internet.

This is not a new concept, just another attempt at an old problem, or
several problems.



h1. Overview

Just getting started, so there's not much to see here...  I'm planning
to drive development of this app to re-implement the site
"sladegenealogy.org":http://sladegenealogy.org/, which represents my
parents' lines.

Additional news on development of this project will be available on
the "yology blog":http://blog.yology.org/
